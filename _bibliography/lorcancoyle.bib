  title = {Making Personalised Flight Recommendations using Implicit Feedback},
  school = {Trinity College Dublin},
  year = {2004},
  abstract = {As e-commerce has become more popular, the problem of information
	overload has come to the fore. Recommender systems that reduce the
	information overload problem are becoming more common. However, the
	problem with many recommender systems is that they are associated
	with a high cost of learning customer preferences (in terms of cognitive
	load). We describe the Personal Travel Assistant (PTA), a flight
	recommender application that uses case-based reasoning (CBR) to overcome
	these problems.

	The PTA allows users to search multiple flights providers concurrently
	and recommends flights based on their individual travel preferences.
	These preferences are implicitly learned from observations of user
	behaviour. When the user purchases a flight, the PTA uses the selection
	of a preferred flight to discover and refine the user's overall travel
	preferences. These preferences are stored in a user-model as sets
	of cases representing their interactions, which are used to provide
	personalised recommendations.

	The PTA makes recommendations taking into account the context in which
	the flights were offered. It uses features from the request to determine
	this context, e.g. the duration of the trip. We perform evaluations
	of contextual recommendations that support our view that user preferences
	change depending on the context of the session. We further improve
	recommendation accuracy by storing and personalising similarity measures
	in the user-model. The PTA alters the relative importance of features
	in the personal similarity measure based on implicit user feedback,
	e.g. increasing the importance of price at the cost of stop-over
	time in a multiple hop flight.

	We also investigate cooperative components to extend our recommendation
	strategies. These allow users to reuse the information learned from
	other users when they encounter new situations. However, these techniques
	are not as successful as we had hoped. We discuss these components
	in relation to other work on collaborative recommendation and suggest
	that the standard approach is unsuited to the PTA's context-based
	recommendation strategy.

	The strength of CBR in the e-commerce domain stems from its reuse
	of the knowledge base associated with a particular application. Since
	case data may be one aspect of a company's entire knowledge system,
	it is important to integrate case data easily within a company's
	IT infrastructure, providing in effect a case-based view on relevant
	portions of the company knowledge base. We describe CBML, an XML-based
	Case Mark-Up Language we have developed to facilitate such integration.},

  abstract = {Though computer scientists agree that conference publications enjoy
	greater status in computer science than in other disciplines, there
	is little quantitative evidence to support this view. The importance
	of journal publication in academic promotion makes it a highly personal
	issue, since focusing exclusively on journal papers misses many significant
	papers published by CS conferences.


	Here, we aim to quantify the relative importance of CS journal and
	conference papers, showing that CS papers in leading conferences
	match the impact of papers in mid-ranking journals and surpass the
	impact of papers in journals in the bottom half of the Thompson Reuters
	rankings (http://www.isiknowledge.com) for impact measured in terms
	of citations in Google Scholar. We also show that poor correlation
	between this measure and conference acceptance rates indicates conference
	publication is an inefficient market where venues equally challenging
	in terms of rejection rates offer quite different returns in terms
	of citations.


	How to measure the quality of academic research and performance of
	particular researchers has always involved debate. Many CS researchers
	feel that performance assessment is an exercise in futility, in part
	because academic research cannot be boiled down to a set of simple
	performance metrics, and any attempt to introduce them would expose
	the entire research enterprise to manipulation and gaming. On the
	other hand, many researchers want some reasonable way to evaluate
	academic performance, arguing that even an imperfect system sheds
	light on research quality, helping funding agencies and tenure committees
	make more informed decisions.


	One long-standing way of evaluating academic performance is through
	publication output. Best practice for academics is to write key research
	contributions as scholarly articles for submission to relevant journals
	and conferences; the peer-review model has stood the test of time
	in determining the quality of accepted articles. However, today's
	culture of academic publication accommodates a range of publication
	opportunities yielding a continuum of quality, with a significant
	gap between the lower and upper reaches of the continuum; for example,
	journal papers are routinely viewed as superior to conference papers,
	which are generally considered superior to papers at workshops and
	local symposia. Several techniques are used for evaluating publications
	and publication outlets, mostly targeting journals. For example,
	Thompson Reuters (the Institute for Scientific Information) and other
	such organizations record and assess the number of citations accumulated
	by leading journals (and some high-ranking conferences) in the ISI
	Web of Knowledge (http://www.isiknowledge.com) to compute the impact
	factor of a journal as a measure of its ability to attract citations.
	Less-reliable indicators of publication quality are also available
	for judging conference quality; for example, a conference's rejection
	rate is often cited as a quality indicator on the grounds that a
	high rejection rate means a more selective review process able to
	generate higher-quality papers. However, as the devil is in the details,
	the details in this case vary among academic disciplines and subdisciplines.


	Here, we examine the issue of publication quality from a CS/engineering
	perspective, describing how related publication practices differ
	from those of other disciplines, in that CS/engineering research
	is mainly published in conferences rather than in journals. This
	culture presents an important challenge when evaluating CS research
	because traditional impact metrics are better suited to evaluating
	journal rather than conference publications.


	In order to legitimize the role of conference papers to the wider
	scientific community, we offer an impact measure based on an analysis
	of Google Scholar citation data suited to CS conferences. We validate
	this new measure with a large-scale experiment covering 8,764 conference
	and journal papers to demonstrate a strong correlation between traditional
	journal impact and our new citation score. The results highlight
	how leading conferences compare favorably to mid-ranking journals,
	surpassing the impact of journals in the bottom half of the traditional
	ISI Web of Knowledge ranking. We also discuss a number of interesting
	anomalies in the CS conference circuit, highlighting how conferences
	with similar rejection rates (the traditional way of evaluating conferences)
	can attract quite different citation counts. We also note interesting
	geographical distinctions in this regard, particularly with respect
	to European and U.S. conferences.},

  abstract = {There are few areas of modern life in which software is not an important
	(though often invisible) component. The software in our lives is
	increasingly complex; its interaction with the real world means that
	its requirements are in a state of constant change (Lehman & Fern\'andez-Ramil,
	2006). Many non-software products and services, from healthcare to
	transport, education to business, depend on reliable, high-quality
	software.


	Software engineering is the activity that applies engineering principles
	to software. It applies systematic, rigorous discipline to the design
	and development of software, much as civil engineering does to construction.
	Software engineering improves the quality, reliability and predictability
	of software systems, by generating knowledge, tools and processes
	that both facilitate and improve the software development process.
	These qualities are essential wherever software failure might lead
	to significant safety, security, or economic losses.


	Software systems frequently need to be modified in response to changes
	in system requirements and in their operational environment (Swanson,
	1976). Such modification may involve the addition of new functionality,
	the adjustment of existing functions, or the wholesale replacement
	of entire sub-systems. All such change is fraught with uncertainty
	--- software projects involving change frequently fail to meet requirements,
	run over time and budget, or are abandoned (Rajlich and Bennett,
	2000). As the ubiquity and complexity of software increase, a requirement
	has emerged for critical software which can successfully evolve without
	loss of quality --- software that is engineered from the start to
	be easily changed, extended and reconfigured, while retaining its
	security, its performance, its reliability and predictability.},
