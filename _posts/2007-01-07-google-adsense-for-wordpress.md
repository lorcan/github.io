Today I added some google ads to this blog. I'm hoping that I can raise enough to pay for my hosting. I've added a <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/skyscraper">skyscraper</a> ad to the right sidebar and a <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/banner">banner</a> ad at the bottom of each post. I've included detailed instructions as to how AdSense ads can be added to wordpress blogs in this way on <a href="http://lorcancoyle.org/wiki/public/adsense_wordpress">this wiki page</a>.
