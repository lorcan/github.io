I blogged before on the <a href="/blog/2007/01/02/asimo-falls-over/">difficulties of "walking" up stairs</a>. It seems that if you want machinery to climb the stairs you need to control it yourself. Here's a cool video of the WL-16IV (<a href="http://robot.watch.impress.co.jp/cda/news/2007/03/07/395.html">the originating website is here</a>, but it's not in english):
