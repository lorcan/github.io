It's not what you think... On Halloween last year, south of San Francisco, two drunken lads out to impress their lady friends decided to visit an ostrich ranch. They climbed into a paddock and woke <a href="http://www.smdailyjournal.com/article_preview.php?id=66599">Gaylord</a> - a 130kg male ostrich - who was not impressed with their antics. He attacked the pair, breaking ribs, and giving the ladies something to be impressed with. The pair beat a hasty retreat and returned with guns to settle the score, as you do when you haven't grown up watching <a href="http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Big_Bird">Sesame Street</a>. The <a href="http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,22549763-5012895,00.html">story</a> ended earlier this month with <a href="http://www.metro.co.uk/weird/article.html?in_article_id=69420&in_page_id=2">jail sentences</a> for the two. I'd hate to be either of those lads on the bus to <a href="/blog/2007/02/04/seinfeld-goes-to-prison/">prison</a> and be asked what I was doing time for... (thanks graeme.)
