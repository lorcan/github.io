Came across <a href="http://feltron.com/">Feltron's website</a>. He's been doing annual reports summarising his activities. Here are his reports for <a href="http://feltron.com/05report_index.html">2005</a> and <a href="http://feltron.com/06report_index.html">2006</a> (2006 is more detailed). Very cool, kooky and quite possibly insane (but who could fault anyone who is a fan of <a href="http://feltron.com/catch22_index.html">Catch 22</a>, even if Milo bought his eggs in Malta not Auckland). I like the 2% assumed margin of error in drinks statistics on the 2006 report.
