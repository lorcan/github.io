<p>Steve Wynn is a Las Vegas casino mogul, and the owner of a substantial art collection. In October 2006 it was announced that he had damaged <em><a title="Le Reve (The Dream)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Reve_%28The_Dream%29">Le Rêve</a></em>, a Picasso painting he had agreed to sell for $139million (this would have been a record price for a piece of art). It emerged that he had punctured the picture with his elbow while showing it to friends. There's an <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/talk/content/articles/061023ta_talk_paumgarten">great article about the incident here </a>in the New Yorker, and Nora Ephron, who was one of the friends who in the room at the time, wrote a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nora-ephron/my-weekend-in-vegas_b_31800.html">blog piece about it here</a>. It seems he took the incident in great spirit.
