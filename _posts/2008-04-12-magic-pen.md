ConorN sent me a cool game called <a href="http://magic.pen.fizzlebot.com/">Magic Pen</a>. Use the mouse to draw shapes, which manifest themselves as physical objects that obey Newtonian laws of motion and gravity. The goal is to move the red ball to capture the flags. Lots of structures, balls, pins, and swivels. Lots of fun but not quite as addictive as <a href="/blog/2007/02/23/planarity-addiction">Planarity</a>. Even so, I've spent far too long today playing it ;-)
