<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/meast/05/24/egypt.snakes.ap/index.html">Customs officers at Cairo's airport stopped a man, Yahia Rahim Tulba, from boarding a plane for Saudi Arabia. He was found to be carrying 700 live snakes in a carry on bag.</a> I'm not sure where Samuel L. Jackson was at the time, but if those snakes had gotten on board, I'm sure he'd have had something to say about <a href="http://www.snakesonaplane.com/">the situation</a> (thanks steve):
