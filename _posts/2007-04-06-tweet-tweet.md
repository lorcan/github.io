So, I've set myself up an account with <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://lorcancoyle.org/wiki/public/xhtml_twitter">added a Twitter badge to the blog sidebar</a>. I'll be trying to keep it up to date over the coming weeks as a trial to see how it all goes. For those of you who don't know, Twitter answers a single question: "What are you doing now?". If you sign up for Twitter, you will see what all your friends are doing now. You can update it from IM, the twitter website, or a text message. <del>I'm using <a href="http://www.google.com/talk/">google talk</a> to keep my twitter up to date, and what I'm doing will be visible here on this blog.</del>
