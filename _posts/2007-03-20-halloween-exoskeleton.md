If you want people to kneel down in awe (and fear) when you enter a room and you think that riding around in your own <a href="/blog/2007/03/19/robots-that-can-walk-up-stairs/">robotic seat</a> just doesn't do it for you, what you need is your own exoskeleton, just like Ripley in the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090605/">Aliens</a> movie (apparently it was called the Caterpillar Power Loader J-5000). Check out this video of <a href="http://hallert.net/powerloader/">the best Halloween costume I've ever seen</a>:
