Everyone knows that a lung full of Helium makes the pitch of your voice rise. This is due to the speed of sound through the gas, and is safe because Helium is inert (and so doesn't burn or react with the contents of your lungs). Well, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur_hexafluoride">Sulfur hexaflouride</a> is an inert gas that is both heavier than air and allows sound to travel through it significantly slower. Here's a cool video that demonstrates these features.
