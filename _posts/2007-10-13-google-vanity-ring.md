<a href="http://infosthetics.com/archives/2007/10/google_vanity_ring.html">Infosthetics posted during the week</a> about <a href="http://www.digital.udk-berlin.de/en/projects/summer07/haupt/bodytech/googlering.html">a Google vanity ring</a> (there's a video <a href="http://www.markuskison.de/ring/VanityRing-Video.html">here</a>)... It's a little ring with an LCD display that shows how many hits the wearer gets on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egosurfing">Google vanity search</a>... Is this the ultimate yuppy nerd toy? A nice spin-off that I know many academic-types would love would be a <a href="http://www.harzing.com/resources.htm#/pop.htm">publish or perish</a> citation count ring... ;-)
