So the <a href="/blog">blog</a> and <a href="/">website</a> have been down for some time now (hardware issues). I've finally gotten the time to get things back up and running. The blog/wiki/website are now being run from a datacentre in Texas (apparently) courtesy of <a href="http://www.webfaction.com/">Webfaction</a>. I'm on a plan that offers 4GB of memory and 600GB of bandwidth! I'll write more on this later both here and on the <a href="/wiki">wiki</a>. In the meantime, I'd be interested to see if anyone has any comments on the new <a href="/">root of the website</a>, <a href="http://lorcancoyle.org/bibliography">my new bibliography</a> (both powered by <a href="http://drupal.org">drupal</a>), and on the blog itself. Also, since I've got a stupid amount of bandwidth going unused, if anyone has any ideas on what to do with it I'm all ears... (obviously no piracy)
