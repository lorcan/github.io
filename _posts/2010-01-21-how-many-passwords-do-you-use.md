It was <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2010/0121/breaking69.htm">just announced</a> that <a href="www.boards.ie>boards.ie</a> was hacked and usernames and passwords stolen. Now, I'd hate to have used a good password on boards, e.g., the password for my facebook account or gmail account. The first thing BB would do if it was him would be to log into your account and see if you're a <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/34860637/ns/technology_and_science-security/">spreader of rumors</a> or if you are friends with a spreader of rumors. Just how much of your personal identity is on social networking sites? Just how much private information is in your email account? Did you use the same facebook password as your email account? Change them now! There are lots of guidance on picking strong passwords, e.g., from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/protect/fraud/passwords/create.aspx">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/PasswordHelp">Google</a>, and <a href="http://security.yahoo.com/article.html?aid=2006102509">Yahoo</a>.
