On May 20th the VNN Vanguard Nazi/KKK tried to hold a rally in Knoxville, Tennessee. However, they didn't count on facing down the 100th Anti Racist Action Clown Block. The clowns found it difficult to understand the racists and a breakdown in communication led the leader of the racist group to lunge at them in a fit of rage and get himself arrested. <a href="http://asheville.indymedia.org/article/107Clowns">Asheville Indymedia ran a great story on the event... well worth a read</a>. Nedless to say the stoopid <a href="http://www.sunnyhillsdrama.com/men's%20monologues.htm#PRODUCERS">noses</a> went home with their tails between their legs and the clowns triumphed... well done clowns!
