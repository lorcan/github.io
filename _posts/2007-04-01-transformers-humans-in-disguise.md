The <a href="http://www.transformersmovie.com/">new Transformers movie</a> is coming out on the 4th of July, (the trailers look awesome!). We may have had the toys, we may have dreamed of dressing up in transformer costumes, but transformer costumes that actually transformed! That would have been beyond any rational child's imagination. And yet...

Good and all as these costumes are, they are still a distant second to a <a href="/blog/2007/03/19/halloween-exoskeleton/">Caterpillar Power Loader J-5000 costume</a>. (thanks gordo.)
