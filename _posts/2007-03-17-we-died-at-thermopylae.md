Here's <a href="http://www.gymjones.com/knowledge.php?id=35">an article from Gym Jones with descriptions of how the actors/extras trained for the 300</a> (previous posts on <a href="http://300themovie.warnerbros.com/">the 300</a> <a href="/blog/2007/01/03/300-trailer/">here</a> and <a href="/blog/2007/03/08/another-300-trailer/">here</a>). 10-12 hours a day, five days a week for four months... that's what it took to die at Thermopylae. (thanks gordo.)
