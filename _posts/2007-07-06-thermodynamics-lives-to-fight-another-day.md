So doomsday came and went and nothing happened. You know, <a href="http://www.steorn.com/">Stoern</a>'s Orbo technology, it was <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/12/03/ginger_aka_it_aka_segway/">going to change everything</a>. Well, unfortunately for all, and unsurprisingly for some, there were some problems and Stoern had to postpone their much anticipated <a href="http://www.steorn.com/orbo/demo/">demo</a>. <a href="http://machinist.salon.com/">The machinist</a> is <em><a href="http://machinist.salon.com/blog/2007/07/05/steorn/">running a wonderful piece of schadenfreude on Stoern's problems</a></em>. I mean over-heating... it's as if <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy">there is more energy coming out than is being put in. That's just impossible</a>, <a href="http://www.steorn.com/orbo/claim/">right?</a>
