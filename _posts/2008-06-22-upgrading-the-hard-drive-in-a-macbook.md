Two days ago I upgraded the hard drive in my MacBook from Apple's paltry default 80G to 250G. I bought a <a href="https://www.komplett.ie/k/ki.aspx?sku=338050">compliant hard drive from komplett.ie</a> for â‚¬76 and followed <a href="http://manuals.info.apple.com/en/MacBook_13inch_HardDrive_DIY.pdf">Apple's straightforward instructions</a>. Everything seems to be working well, so it looks like I got a great deal on my upgrade (as I did when <a href="/blog/2007/10/27/upgrading-ram-a-macbook">I upgraded the RAM in my laptop</a>). The natural order has been restored and my laptop has more space than my ipod :-D
