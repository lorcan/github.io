Early on in every relationship the toilet seat issue rears its ugly head. Usually this manifests itself in a single question: "Why won't he leave the seat down?" Well science has come to the rescue in the form of <a href="http://www.msu.edu/~choijay/">Jay Pil Choi, an economist from Michigan State University</a>. He published a paper in 2002 called "<a href="http://www.msu.edu/~choijay/etiquette.pdf">Up or Down? A Male Economist's Manifesto on the Toilet Seat Etiquette</a>". The brief summary of the paper's conclusions is that unless it is much more inconvenient for one gender to change the seat position, the selfish rule - whereby the seat is left in whatever state the last user needed it - is the most efficient in terms of overall convenience... But then we already knew that guys, didn't we? ;-)
