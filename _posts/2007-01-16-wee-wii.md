Lots of people wondered what Nintendo were thinking when they called it the <a href="http://wii.nintendo.com/">Wii</a>. It all sounded a little close to wee. Surely nobody would buy it. But who knew that the choice of name would lead to a death? Well, it happened... and all because of a <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/01/15/wii_death/">Hold Your Wee for a Wii</a> competition. It never would have happened if they'd just called it something innocuous<em> </em>like the revolution.
