This morning I upgraded the RAM in my MacBook from 1G of RAM to 2G. I bought 2 <a href="https://www.komplett.ie/k/ki.aspx?sku=318078">compliant 1G RAM chips from komplett.ie</a> for €27 each and followed <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=303721">Apple's straightforward instructions</a>. Everything seems to be working well, so for €54+delivery it looks like I got a great deal on my upgrade. Now, my poor laptop should be able to run <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> without stuttering :-D
