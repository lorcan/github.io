Lawrence Saul posted a great page on <a href="http://www.cse.ucsd.edu/~saul/blog.html">his minimalist blog</a> <a href="http://www.cse.ucsd.edu/~saul/24.html">here which describes how Jack Bauer writes academic papers</a>. From the page: "To commemorate the <a href="http://oregonstate.edu/conferences/icml2007/">Twenty Fourth Annual International Conference on Machine Learning</a> (ICML-07), the FOX Network has decided to launch a new spin-off series in prime time." (thanks P.)
