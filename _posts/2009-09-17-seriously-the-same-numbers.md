Some people are walking around with a super grin this week... 

<a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0917/breaking62.htm">The same numbers just turned up in the Bulgarian lottery this week that turned up last week...</a> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2009/s2689394.htm">seriously</a>. It was bound to happen sooner or later somewhere, all the same, I can't help thinking about Billy Covington and the Thai state lottery.

Now my question is this: what kind of weirdo plays the numbers that won last week? There's eighteen of them in Bulgaria apparently... I wonder if they will play them again next week... weirdos.
