For those of us who grew up playing with the <a href="http://www.c64.com/">Commodore 64</a> before shifting to big PC boxes it felt like a step backward from a aesthetics perspective to move from a PC encased in a keyboard to a (not-much-smaller) keyboard attached to a big ugly box that sat under the desk. KC has been talking for years about the inevitability of a shift backward to flatter computers in keyboards and for a while it looked like everyone was simply content to down-shift to a laptop. I have to say, <a href="http://eeepc.asus.com/global/index.html">Asus</a> have revealed something that should satisfy everyone. It's a fabulously flat keyboard that has everything you'd need to connect to a larger screen. Oh, and it also has a 5 inch touch screen on it too, just in case you're on the road (or if you don't need the larger screen space)! <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/01/06/asus-eee-keyboard-revealed/">Engadget has a story here with sexy photos, well worth a look</a>. Needless to say, I want!
