Google today announced <a href="http://www.google.com/tisp/">Google TiSP</a>, a new free broadband service. The terms are pretty standard - the free "Trickle" service offers 8 Mbps maximum download, with 2 Mbps maximum upload. However, the downside is in the small print, where Google promise to continue trampling on personal privacy - from <a href="http://www.google.com/tisp/faq.html">the FAQ</a>: "To offset the cost of providing the TiSP service, we use information gathered by discreet DNA sequencing of your personal bodily output to display online ads that are contextually relevant to your culinary preferences, current health status and likelihood of developing particular medical conditions going forward". Scary stuff! Fortunately, for European privacy activists, the service is currently only available in the USA and Canada. However, if Google continues to lead the world in the development of <a href="http://www.google.com/technology/pigeonrank.html">innovate alternative technologies</a> it will have no problem rolling out TiSP world-wide by this day next year.
