I came across <a href="http://no-www.org">No-www</a> some time ago and they caught my attention in a big way. Why do we use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Www#WWW_prefix_in_Web_addresses">www</a>? It's gotta be past its usefulness and No-www think we should deprecate it. So, with this in mind this website doesn't do www - if you load <a href="http://www.lorcancoyle.org">www.lorcancoyle.org</a> you get <a href="http://lorcancoyle.org">lorcancoyle.org</a>. I just got validated by the good people at No-www and am proudly displaying my <a href="http://no-www.org/faq.php?q=class_b">Class B</a> certification (near the bottom of the right sidebar).
