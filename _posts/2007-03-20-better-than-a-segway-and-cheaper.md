The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segway">Segway</a> looked great when it came out, but it's just too expensive (and slow). <a href="http://hackedgadgets.com/2007/03/12/5-cool-self-balancing-skateboards/">There's a cool line-up of alternatives on hackedgadgets.com</a>. My favourites are <a href="http://www.hackaday.com/2007/03/10/cheap-balancing-skateboard/">the Skatanova, previewed by Hackaday a few weeks back</a> and <a href="http://www.ben.jellybaby.net/">the balancing one-wheeled scooter</a>. <a href="http://www.kysotech.com/projects/skatanova.html">The Skatanova is powered with a pair of cordless drills. There are lots of implementation details on its creator, Tony Ozrelic's site</a>. Here's a video of the balancing one-wheeled scooter from ben.jellybaby.net (lots of implementation details on <a href="http://ben.jellybaby.net/">the website</a>):
