<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Independent_Creative_Editors">The Association of Independent Creative Editors</a> ran a competition in 2005 for people to re-edit movie trailers re-cutting the film's visuals but changing the genre. The winner was "Shining" - Stanley Kubrick's horror movie re-cut as a romantic comedy (<a href="http://www.tatteredcoat.com/archives/2005/09/28/the-shining-redux/">there's lots of information on Shining on the tattered coat's blog</a>):

Since then lots more of these have emerged. My personal favourite is "Must Love Jaws" - Jaws re-cut as a love story: (thanks enda.)

Another great one is Caakth?l -  Cocktail re-cut in the Bollywood style:
