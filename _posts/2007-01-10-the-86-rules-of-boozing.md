Very cool set of drinking rules I got <a href="http://www.moderndrunkardmagazine.com/issues/01-02/01_02_booze_rules.htm">here</a> (well, from <a href="http://yourhtmlsource.com/phdblog/2007/01/09/links-for-2007-01-09/">Ross</a> actually). Quite American oriented, but some classics that have got to be universal, e.g. Rule 31: If you have been room mates with someone more than six months, you may drink all their beer, even if it's hidden, as long as you leave them one; Rule 69: If there is ever any confusion, the fuller beer is yours; and finally, my favourite, Rule 61: Never rest your head on a table or bar top. It is the equivalent of voluntarily putting your head on a chopping block.
