It is what is says... the sound quality is very poor, but here's William Shatner at the Science Fiction Film awards in 1978 interpreting (read bludgeoning) Elton John's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocketman">Rocketman</a> (Shatner is introduced here by Bernie Taupin, who wrote the lyrics). This was parodied brilliantly by Stewie Griffin in Family Guy (in the episode "...And the Wiener Is").
