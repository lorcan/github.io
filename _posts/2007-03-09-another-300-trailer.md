I <a href="/blog/2007/01/03/300-trailer/">posted earlier</a> about the <a href="http://300themovie.warnerbros.com/">300 movie</a> out this month. <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/wb/300/trailer1/">Apple have a second trailer here</a>. There's lots of cool historical information on the battle on which the movie is based <a href="http://www.livius.org/a/battlefields/thermopylae/thermopylae.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/leonidas-i">a great biography of Leonidas I here, with descriptions of the battle</a>. This is gonna be great.
