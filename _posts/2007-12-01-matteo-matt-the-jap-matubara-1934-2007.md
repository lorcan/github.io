<a href="http://www.ireland.com/newspaper/frontpage/2007/1201/1196375108237.html">Today's Irish times announced the death of Matteo Matubara</a> (better known among Trinity students as Matt the Jap). He was one of <a href="http://www.tcd.ie/">Trinity College</a>'s best known eccentric personalities, and few students who attended the college would have been unfamiliar with the sight of Matteo shuffling across front square. There were many rumours among students about his life and background, and the Irish Times notice only hints at the possibilities. More rumours/witness accounts are available on <a href="http://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=187840&page=2">boards</a> and <a href="http://www.politics.ie/viewtopic.php?t=29110">politics.ie</a>.
