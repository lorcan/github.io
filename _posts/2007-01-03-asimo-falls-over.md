So I was shown this video of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asimo">Asimo</a> robot "walking" up a set of stairs. Although its walk is quite human-like, its fall is something else completely... if you cringed, it shows that maybe humans are more compassionate towards robots than futurists would have predicted. If you laughed, join my club ;-)
