300, the new film based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller looks amazing (<a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/wb/300/">trailer </a>here, movie website <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_%28film%29">here</a>). I suspect this will be one to watch in 2007. It's about the Spartan's fight against the Persian invasion of Greece at the battle of Thermopylae in 480BC. 300 Spartans fight at a mountain pass to delay the Persian's overwhelming force (there is some question of the actual number of invaders, perhaps a hundred thousand, perhaps 2 million...). Anyway, I digress, take a look at the trailer, the visuals, as you would expect are awesome...
