I visited <a href="http://www.heanet.ie/">HEANet</a> last week with a group of computer scientists and what fun we had. We learned many things: that the Internet in Ireland is mostly blue; that fat pipes are not fat at all; and that fibre transports a ridiculous amount of data. But we were all disappointed not to see the Big Red Button (you know, the one that turns off the Internet). Speaking of Big Red Buttons, here's a great story about what happens when <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/The_Big_Red_Button.aspx">Take-Your-Child-To-Work comes to the data-centre</a> (the comments section is full of other cautionary tales). This incident is apparently the origin of the <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/molly-guard">molly-guard</a>... (thanks Ado.)
