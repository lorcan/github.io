Well, unofficially that is. At least according to the <a href="http://www.ufwc.co.uk/">Unofficial Football World Championship</a>. They won the championship when they beat Georgia last Saturday, who beat Uruguay back in November, who beat Venezuela back in October, and so on, back to the first international football match, well, actually the second - the first was a draw (England beat Scotland 4-2 in the second to take the first title). Interestingly, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unofficial_Football_World_Championships#Rankings_table">Scotland have retained the championship longer than any other country (13,000 days and counting)</a>. On Wednesday they will take on official champions Italy. If Italy win, the official and unofficial championships will be united for the first time since France lost it to Spain on the 28th March 2001. Of course, Scotland <em>could</em> beat Italy or draw to retain the unofficial championship. (thanks graeme.)
