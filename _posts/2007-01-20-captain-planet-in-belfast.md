I don't know if anyone remembers Captain Planet, a really annoying cartoon about an annoying superhero and five equally annoying kids with fancy annoying rings and annoying special powers. They went around saving the planet and making environmentalism "cool". This clip from an episode set in Belfast sums up the show completely. If only we listened to Captain Planet, we could truly make the world a better place. And check out the dodgy accents! It's programs like Captain Planet that make <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainforest_Schmainforest">South Park's <em>Rainforest Schmainforest</em></a> episode so good!
