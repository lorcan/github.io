A Canadian company, <a href="http://www.xyzimaging.com/">XYZ Imaging</a>, have developed a way of printing large production ready <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holography">holograms</a> from purely digital media. They have some very <a href="http://www.xyzrgb.com/holos/index.html">nice videos here</a> and a short video with examples here:
<object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/MqRMktn-adM" width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/MqRMktn-adM" /><param name="wmode" value="transparent" /></object>
There was <a href="http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/business/story.html?id=1a03c433-4686-46d2-a669-854f4f03b6c8">an interesting article about this in the Ottawa Citizen back in November</a>. There's something incredibly cool about storing 6 seconds of real-time motion in a poster. Expect to see many more of these in the future. (Thanks gordon.)
