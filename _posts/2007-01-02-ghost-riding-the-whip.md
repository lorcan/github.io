So there's been some coverage of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostriding">ghost riding</a> phenomenon on the papers. So Ghost Riding is where you drive a car and jump out while its moving and dance beside it or on the roof. So here's some amusing clips of ghost riding going wrong... this one is pretty hardcore, with an obvious outcome:

And this one is less predictable and probably fake:
