<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/south_yorkshire/6523197.stm">BBC News ran a story a few days ago on the new craze of bin sniffing</a>. Apparently, since legislation in the UK has made it harder for kids to buy glue or lighter fluid, innovative glue-sniffers are finding other sources of amusement. <a href="http://news.scotsman.com/uk.cfm?id=1066342002">The Scotsman ran a similar story back in 2002</a> describing how bins and bus shelters were showing up with dinner plate-sized holes in them; the footprint of the bin-sniffers. And the reason it's possible to get a high from bin-sniffing? (<a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20040624/ai_n12793077">here comes the science bit</a>) "<a href="http://www.metro.co.uk/news/article.html?in_article_id=44248&in_page_id=34">Wheelie bins are made from high density polyethylene - composed of double-bonded carbon and hydrogen molecules. Burning an empty one releases carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. These deadly gases starve the brain of oxygen, giving a headacheheavy short high.</a>" I wonder what other more-interesting chemicals are being released... (thanks gordo.)
