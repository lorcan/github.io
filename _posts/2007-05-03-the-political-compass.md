So <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertie_Ahern">Bertie</a> finally announced an election date for the next DÃ¡il - May 24th. <a href="http://www.hotgazpacho.co.uk/2007/04/16/the-political-compass/">Graeme ran a piece two weeks ago</a> on <a href="http://www.politicalcompass.org">Political Compasses</a> showing his score and a comparison of UK political party scores, and said that he could find no suitable UK party to match his score. I took the test myself just now, and according to <a href="http://www.politicalcompass.org/ireland">Political.Compass.org's information on Irish Parties</a> my scores (Economic Left/Right: -0.75, Social Libertarian/Authoritarian: -4.97) predict that I should be voting either for the <a href="http://www.greenparty.ie/">Green Party</a> or the <a href="http://www.labour.ie/">Labour Party</a> (or even better, for <a href="http://www.politicalcompass.org/analysis2">Gandhi</a> if he was standing for election). Perhaps there should be a question in the test asking whether your grandparents were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_parties_in_the_Republic_of_Ireland">pro- or anti-treaty</a>? ;-) 
<a href="http://www.politicalcompass.org/questionnaire">What score did you get on the political compass?</a>
