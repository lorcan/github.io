So after watching Back to the Future Pt. 2, I started reading up on it and came across <a href="http://www.scifiscripts.com/scripts/back_to_the_future_original_draft.html">the original script.</a> It's the same in many ways but with a completely different, more interesting, and probably less commercial ending.
