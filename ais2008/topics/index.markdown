<p>The workshop topics are for the most part listed as a set of questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How are ambient information systems distinct from other information technologies?</li>
<li>What are examples of useful heuristics, frameworks, taxonomies, or design principles for the implementation of ambient information?</li>
<li>Should Ambient Information Systems move beyond the traditional scope of vision; is there merit in Ambient Noise, Ambient Smells, Tactile Ambience, and Ambient Taste?</li>
<li>How much ambient information can one perceive and comprehend?</li>
<li>What, if any, are the appropriate interaction methods for these information devices?</li>
<li>Where should ambient systems be placed to improve their chances of being used, without becoming distracting or annoying?</li>
<li>What sorts of information are best conveyed by an ambient display?</li>
<li>What are the appropriate methods for evaluating ambient information systems, particularly those that are not necessarily task-based?</li>
<li>How do we describe the values of these particular technologies in our everyday lives?</li>
<li>How can we make use of existing technologies? (e.g. smart materials, wearable systems, etc.)</li>
<li>What knowledge from other domains should we apply? (e.g., from art, cognitive science, design, psychology, sociology)</li><br />
</ul><br />
We are also particularly interested to hear about ambient information systems in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resource Consumption, e.g.,  power, heat, water, food, and for shared or personal resources</li>
<li>Work and workload "progress" (e.g., explicitly or implicitly gathered data, or those based on a workflow)</li><br />
</ul><br />
If you have any topics you'd like to suggest please add them in the comments below. We'd love to hear from you :-)</p>
