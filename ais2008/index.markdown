<h1>Ambient Information 2008</h1>
<p>The current research in pervasive and ubiquitous computing suggests a future in which we are surrounded by innumerable information sources, all competing for our attention. These information sources may manifest as both novel devices and as devices embedded in common objects, such as  refrigerators, automobiles, toys, furniture, clothes, and even our own bodies.</p>
<p>While this vision of the future has prompted great advancements in context-aware computing, wireless connectivity, multi-sensor platforms, smart materials, and location-tracking technologies, there is a concern that this proliferation of technology will increasingly overwhelm us with information. Our belief is that information should move seamlessly between the periphery and the center of one's attention, and that good technology is highly transparent. We see ambient information systems as a way to support these ideas.</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>Ambient Information Systems describe a large set of applications that publish information in a highly non-intrusive manner, following on from Mark Weiser's concept of <a href="http://www.ubiq.com/weiser/calmtech/calmtech.htm" target="_blank">calm technology</a>. This form of information delivery has manifested in several different implementations, but the overall theme revolves around how best to embed information into our surroundings.</p>
<p>Building on the success of our last <a href="/ais2007/" target="_blank">workshop at Pervasive 2007</a>, we will bring together researchers working in the areas of ambient displays, peripheral displays, slow technology, glanceable displays, and calm technology to discuss and collaborate on developing new design approaches for creating ambient information systems. We are calling for paper submissions describing early-stage and mature research on Ambient Information Systems, and for demonstrators across the spectrum from technology to art and design</p>

This website will act as central locaton for us to publish accepted submissions and slides from this and related workshops. We are also working to collect a list of relevant papers,  journal articles, technologies,  and other resources related to Ambient Information Systems research. We encourage any interested researcher to freely contribute ideas and examples by creating their own account here.</p>
